# Bouncing Ball Animation

This project demonstrates a simple bouncing ball animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ball moves diagonally within the viewport, bouncing back when it reaches the edge.

## Features

- Ball moves smoothly across the screen.
- Changes direction when hitting the edge of the screen.
- Uses JavaScript to calculate movement and direction.

## How It Works

- The ball is represented by a `div` with a circular shape (`border-radius: 50%`).
- JavaScript
